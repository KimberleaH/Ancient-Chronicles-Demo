            <p>Former Lieutenant of the Special Core (disbanded)</p>
            <p>Born and raised in Scaevas along with Dhaam, she narrowly escaped the destruction of her hometown. She and Dhaam are the only 
              known survivors. Having hid in the same spot just on the edge of their village as young children, they witnessed the burning and 
              slaughter of their home. Tehg fled north with Dhaam, and, as adolescents, joined up with Karenwatti's army, a local regiment.</p>
            <p>Tehg would go on to hold multiple positions of command before the end of the war, in turn ending her career as the second-in-command 
              of the Special Corp. Following the war's end, she had been with Onin, the former Keeper of Vah'Vahnet, when they were ambushed. 
              Onin was forced to retire due to the injuries he sustained. He asked Tehg to take his place, finding her to be a worthy successor.</p>
