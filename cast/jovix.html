            <p>Jovix was born in a cozy village on the frozen wastes of Beross. He was orphaned at the tender age of 3 when a Hy'kali raid 
              decimated his home, leaving him alone in the cold. Too young to fend for himself, he faced starvation and hypothermia in the 
              subzero temperatures. Only his core energy kept himself warm enough to survive until he was found huddled amongst the 
              vegetation bordering a geothermal river. He was raised by Thresh'ulaks whom he viewed as his father — yet was never allowed 
              to call him that. He grew being given only basic necessities and very little luxury. It was always expected of him to pull 
              his own weight, even at a young age, and never learned amzor-specific skills like core use and proper flight. As such, he is 
              physically strong but not a skilled energy user or flier. Because of severe malnutrition at an early age, Jovix's development 
              was stunted. He stands just shy of a foot shorter than he would have been.</p>
