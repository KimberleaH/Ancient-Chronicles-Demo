            <p>The majority of Okiri's life was spent in servitude. She started as a servant of the High Seren community, living on the 
              impoverished midland shelf working the land and growing crops for the upper lands' residents. As a young adult, she was 
              fancied as a house worker, providing for a noble seren family for many years. The family's status and connections with the

              official medic for any who needed it. However, her duties expanded when the royal family bore a son. The crown prince. 
              With his birth, Okiri made it her mission to teach him — in secret — lessons that would make him question the actions of his 
              people and all those before him.</p>

                others off the planet. Serpentis became her new home where she met Soma and was invited to take up the role of Keeper.</p>
