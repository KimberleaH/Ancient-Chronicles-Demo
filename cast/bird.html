            <p>Thresh'ulaks grew up in a typical kazanak collective that demanded he learn to fend for himself and contribute to the tribe at 
              a young age. As a user of metal energy, his contributions were often in the form of tools and weaponry used for hunting or 
              fighting off invading bands of Hy'kali. Once he came of age, he left his home tribe in search of a new one to call home. Eventually 
              he settled in a tribe bordering a geothermal river — a reliable source of aquatic resources. Thresh'ulaks made occasional trips to 
              Thanhuul to sell blades and tools. His reputation as a metalsmith in the Berossian spaceport city attracted many from far and wide, 
              eventually connecting him with Zarix, a Peacekeeper representing Beross in need of a Keeper.</p>
            <p>On a fateful day, he found a tiny, skin-and-bones amzor pup in desperate need of help. Thresh had every intention of leaving him 
              but his guilt got the better of him. Begrudgingly, Thresh'ulaks took Jovix in, nursed him back to health, and made many attempts 
              thereafter (over the span of years) to “return the amzor back to the wild.” But Jovix would repeatedly return. Thresh eventually 
              gave up altogether.</p>
